# clean-architecture-node-js
The idea is to create a simple API where it will save leads from the website's contact form. Also, this API should be responsible to send an email to:

- The client
- The stakeholder

## Structure
This project will follow the Clean Architecture (SOLID) suggested by Robert C. Martin. I know there are other architectures (Onion, Hexagonal), but for this specific project it's gonna be Clean Architecture.
